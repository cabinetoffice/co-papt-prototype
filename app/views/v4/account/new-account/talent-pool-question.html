Our Privacy Notice sets out in more detail how we will use your personal data, and your rights. It is made under Articles 13 and/or 14 of the UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). If you are not content to share your personal data for these purposes then you do not need to opt into the talent pool and this does not stop you from applying for public appointment roles. If you opt in but change your mind, you can withdraw your consent from the talent pool at any time and your details will be removed from the database."
